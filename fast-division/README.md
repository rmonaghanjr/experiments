# fast-division-test
Testing the speed of a division trick that I found online.


### results
The amount of time saved by this algorithm, as hypothesized, is truly negligible. A mere `0.005` seconds saved on 100000 divisions.
```
standard division:  0.138751(s)
floating point mul: 0.136475(s)
fast division:      0.133172(s)
```
Still fun to see this in action!
